                  Welcome to the Privacy Policy of Trope ("we", "us", or "our"). We're building services that improve the personal computing experience by understanding your unique context and taking action at your command. When you use our services, you're trusting us to handle your personal data. We take that trust seriously and aim to incorporate privacy principles into every step of what we do, from the ground up.
                </p>

                <p className="text-slate-600 mb-6">
                  This Privacy Policy describes how we handle personal information that we collect through and in connection with our website at https://trope.ai, our applications, and any other website or service that we own or control and that links to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the "Service" or "Services"). This Policy applies to our website visitors, users of our applications, and other individuals who interact with us.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Personal Information We Collect</h2>

                <p className="text-slate-600 mb-6">
                  Our Services are powered by your unique context. We provide a combination of on-device and cloud based Services to collect and process information stored on your device and in your applications. At a high-level, our on-device Services will process your data and send relevant information to our cloud based Services to serve your requests. We will generally rely on the device-level permissions that you control to process your data.
                </p>

                <p className="text-slate-600 mb-6">
                  We primarily collect this contextual data in two ways. First, we collect data that you choose to include in text prompts and workflow recordings to the Services. Second, depending on the permissions you grant on your device and the requests you make, we collect data from your device and applications to serve requests you make to the Services. For example, if you use our Services to record a workflow in your third party application, we will, in order to fulfill your request, collect and process screenshots, UI metadata, and other contextual data that you allow us to access. Therefore, depending on how you use the Services, the data we process from your device can include any data you choose, and may include location information, biographical information, demographic information, and other kinds of information.
                </p>

                <p className="text-slate-600 mb-4">
                  Additionally, we also collect the following categories of personal information about you:
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">Information you provide to us:</h3>

                  <li>Payment information needed to complete your transactions with us, including name, payment card information, and billing information.

                  <li>Communications that we exchange with you, including when you contact us with questions, feedback, or otherwise.</li>
                  <li>Visual and audio information, such as screenshots, screen recordings, or user-generated content that you upload or otherwise provide through the Services.</li>

                  Where you provide us with the personal information of third parties, such as your team members or other contacts, it is your responsibility to inform them about the processing of their personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and to confirm that they have given their permission.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">Automatic data collection</h3>

                <p className="text-slate-600 mb-4">
                  We and our service providers may automatically log and combine information about you, your computer or mobile device, and your interactions over time with the Services, online resources, and our communications, such as:
                </p>

                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-slate-600 mb-6 space-y-2">

                  We use the following tools for automatic data collection for advertising and personalization purposes:
                </p>

                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-slate-600 mb-6 space-y-2">
                  <li>Cookies, which are text files that websites store on a visitor's device to uniquely identify the visitor's browser or to store information or settings in the browser for the purpose of helping you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, enabling functionality, and helping us understand user activity and patterns.</li>
                  <li>Local storage technologies, like SQLite, that provide cookie-equivalent functionality but can store larger amounts of data, including on your device outside of your browser in connection with specific applications.</li>
                  <li>Web beacons, also known as pixel tags or clear GIFs, which are used to demonstrate that a webpage or email was accessed or opened, or that certain content was viewed or clicked.</li>
                </ul>
